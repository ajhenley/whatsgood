Hooray, you just installs required files to fully customize your get shit done
pro theme.

If you curious what the customize generator done so far, actually, it created the
following scss in your app:

  * app/assets/stylesheets/gsdk_pro.scss

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet

  * Ensure your have run install generator before this customize generator.
    Since install generator will create all necessary files in order to make
    this gem work.

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/gsdk_pro.css has been removed as we will use 
    app/assets/stylesheets/gsdk_pro.scss for customize get shit done pro style.

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/gsdk_pro.scss is loaded in application.css
    with `require_tree .` or `require gsdk_pro`.

  * Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
    For example:

      root to: "home#index"

  * If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

      config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

    On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB or
    load models when precompiling your assets.
